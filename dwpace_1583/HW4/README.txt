Compile by using:
javac VirtualPet.java

How the game works:
Your pet has stats, as the days go by the pet gradually gets harder and harder to keep from running away. Depending on the choices made by the player, and a bunch of randomness, the stats are altered.

I did the bonuses. 
1. I included a highscores at the end
2. I included multiple tradeoffs, with narratives
3. I included textual descriptions

The game is designed to end roughly after every possible outcome is shown. (Max I got was 20)
In order to test the highscores, you can type "kill", and the game will restart after showing the highscores.
